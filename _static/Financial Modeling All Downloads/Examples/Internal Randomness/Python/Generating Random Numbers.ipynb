    "# Generating Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on how we can generate both continuous and discrete random variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the built-in module `random` which helps with generating random numbers in Python, whether continous or discrete. We will also look at `numpy.random` which allows generating more than one random number at once with a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "Continous random variables are those which can take on any value in some range. The probability distribution is defined by a curve which describes the probability of any given value in the range, e.g. the normal distribution. We will focus on the normal distribution because as mentioned in the lecture, it fits well with most of the inputs we'll be modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Single Continuous Random Number\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the `random` built-in module to generate numbers from a normal distribution. Every normal distribution has a mean and standard deviation. So we must decide which mean and standard deviation are appropriate for our variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the case of an investment portfolio return. A typical portfolio return may be in the range of 2-10%, but can go outside that sometimes. So let's pick the midpoint of that range, 6%, as the mean. For the standard deviation, you can think of a single standard deviation as a typical deviation, two standard deviations as occurring occasionally, three standard deviations occurring rarely. So if we use 3% as the standard deviation, that should fit the return distribution well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the `random.normalvariate` function to pull a random number from a normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation."
