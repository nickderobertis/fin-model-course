\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is a DCF?}
\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{discounted cash flow valuation (DCF)} is a method of determining the value of a stock.
\vfill
\item Other ways include the dividend discount model and approaches based on comparables
\vfill
\item The dividend discount model only works well for stable companies that pay dividends with constant growth.
\vfill
\item Comparable approaches can give a rough idea of a valuation but never take into account the specifics of the company
\vfill
\item DCF valuation can be applied to any company and is based on the particulars of the company

$r_i = r_f + \beta (r_m - r_f) + \epsilon$

\begin{itemize}
\item The three returns can all be estimated from historical data. Therefore $\beta$ and $\epsilon$ are the unknowns. But $\epsilon$ has mean zero so we can ignore it for estimation.
\vfill
\item We will estimate the historical beta, then assume that the beta is still valid today to come up with the current $r_i$ as the cost of equity.
\vfill
\item $\beta$ can be estimated by regressing the historical stock returns of the company on the historical market risk premiums. The $\beta$ is then the coefficient of the market risk premium in the regression.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Overview of Estimating the Cost of Debt}
\begin{itemize}
\item We want to estimate the cost of debt for the company, which more specifically should be the marginal interest cost of raising one additional dollar via debt.
\vfill
\item There are two general approaches to estimating this: the
\underline{financial statements approach}
and the
\underline{market value of bonds approach}
\vfill
\item The market value of bonds approach is better able to capture the current rate when it has changed substantially over time, but it requires price, coupon, and maturity information on a bond.
\vfill
\item The financial statements approach uses only the income statement and balance sheet, and represents a weighted average historical cost of debt.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Financial Statements Approach to Cost of Debt}
\begin{itemize}
\item The financial statements approach uses interest expense from the income statement and total debt from the balance sheet to estimate the cost of debt
\vfill
\item With this approach, we can estimate the cost of debt by a very simple formula
\vfill
\item $r_d = \frac{\text{Interest Expense}}{\text{Total Debt}}$
\vfill
\item Calculate this for the most recent data available and use this as the cost of debt
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Market Value of Bonds Approach to Cost of Debt}
\begin{itemize}
\item The cost of debt is about raising new debt, so it is more accurate to look at the market to determine how much the company would have to pay for new debt.
\vfill
\item The yield to maturity (YTM) of the company's bonds can be calculated. A weighted average of the YTMs can be used as an estimate of the cost of debt.
\vfill
\item The YTM is representing the required rate of return on the bond for the investor, which is equivalent to the cost of the bond for the company
\vfill
\item The YTM is simply the IRR of the bond, considering the current market price of the bond
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is the Market Value of Debt?}
\begin{itemize}
\item If you have taken the debt course, you should be familiar with the fact that bonds' values change over time.
\vfill
\item The value of a bond can be determined (just like any financial asset) by taking the present value of future cash flows (here, interest and principal payments). 
\vfill
\item If the discount rate for the company changes, the value of the bonds change, as the interest payments are contracted and will remain the same
\vfill
\item The discount rate will change when the riskiness of the firm's debt changes, e.g. taking on additional debt, starting a new project, having a bad operating year, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Should we Care about the Market Value of Debt?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Say a company issues a 3-year bond with a 10\% coupon. When issued, the riskiness of the firm implies it should have a 10\% discount rate. In other words, the true cost of debt is 10\%. The bond is at par (value 1,000).
\vfill
\item One year later, the firm has a bad year, and now lenders are requiring a 15\% rate to lend to the company
\vfill
\item Due to this, the price of the existing bond has dropped to \$918.71.
\vfill
\item If we calculate the IRR on this \$918.71 bond, it comes to 15\%, which is the true YTM or cost of debt
\vfill
\item The coupon rate on the bond is still 10\%, and the book value of debt on the balance sheet is still 1,000 so based on the financial statements approach the cost of debt would still be 10\%.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{After-Tax Cost of Debt}
\begin{itemize}
\small
\vfill
\item Debt has an interesting feature in our tax system: debt is
\underline{tax deductible.}
\vfill
\item The amount a company has to pay in income tax is taken as a percentage of earnings before tax (EBT).
\vfill
\item As interest is taken out while calculating EBT, it lowers the tax payment.
\vfill
\item Think about two hypothetical companies with the exact same operations, revenues, costs, etc. One is financed completely with equity and the other with 50\% debt. They will both have the same EBIT but the EBT will be lower for the debt firm and so the taxes will be lower for the debt firm, likely giving the debt firm a higher value than the equity firm.
\vfill
\item What this means for cost of capital estimation is that all our calculations will be based on pre-tax numbers, then we multiply by $(1 - \text{tax rate})$ to get the after-tax cost of debt to use in the WACC.

\underline{assume the book value of debt equals the market value of debt.}

\begin{itemize}
\item For the purposes of this class, we won't deal with seniority. But you should keep it in mind in the future when estimating the market value of debt.
\vfill
\item Seniority represents the payoff order during bankruptcy. The most senior loans will be paid first, and if there is still money left over, then the more junior loans will be paid.
\vfill
\item As there is a higher expected value in recovery, senior loans are less risky and so should have a lower rate associated with them.
\vfill
\item In the prior exercise, when valuing individual debt instruments, we assumed a single cost of debt, when in reality, it should be adjusted for the seniority.
