    "`xlwings` has some great features for working with arrays where you may not know the size in advance. This is very useful in cases where you want to take the number of time periods in a model as an input. It could also be useful in a lot of other cases where you don't know the size of the data. E.g. you are calculating average portfolio returns, but you want the workbook to automatically pick it up when you add a new asset."
