Description
--------------

- Now we want to see the effect of savings rate on time until retirement, in addition to interest rate
- In both Excel and Python, calculate the years to retirement for savings rates of 10%, 25%, and 40%, and each of these cases with each of the interest rate cases, 4%, 5%, and 6%
- Be sure that you drag formulas in Excel and use for loops in Python to accomplish this
- In total you should have 9 calculated years to retirement numbers, in each of the two models.

- Do this without writing the to_excel command multiple times

Level 3
^^^^^^^^^^

- Note: this exercise uses the Advanced material covered in the example Jupyter notebook Read Write Excel Pandas.ipynb
- Use the same "MSFT Financials.xls" from the first exercise
- Output to five separate sheets in the same workbook "My Data.xlsx". The sheets should be named "Income Statement 1", "Income Statement 2", and so on.

Description
--------------

Level 1
^^^^^^^^^^

- For all of the xlwings lab exercises, work with "xlwings Lab.xlsx".
- Use xlwings to read the values in the column A and then write them beside the initial values in column B

Level 2
^^^^^^^^^^

- Get the value in C9 and multiply it by 2.5 in Python

Level 3
^^^^^^^^^^

- Read the table which starts in E4 into Python. Multiply the prices by 2.5, and then output back into Excel starting in cell H5.
- Ensure that the outputted table appears in the same format as the original (pay attention to index and header)

Level 4
^^^^^^^^^^

- In column L, write 5, 10, 15 ... 100 spaced two cells apart, so L1 would have 5, L4 would have 10, and so on.

Description
--------------

Level 1
^^^^^^^^^^

- You are trying to determine the value of a mature company. The company has had stable dividend growth for a long time so you select the dividend discount model (DDM).
- :math:`P = \frac{d_1}{r_s - g}`
- The next dividend will be \$1, and your baseline estimates of the cost of capital and growth are 9% and 4%, respectively
- Write a function which is able to get the price based on values of the inputs
- Then you are concerned about mis-estimation of the inputs and how it could affect the price. So then assume that the growth rate has a mean of 4% but a standard deviation of 1%
- Visualize and summarize the resulting probability distribution of the price

Level 2
^^^^^^^^^^

- Continue from the first lab exercise
- Now you are also concerned you have mis-estimated the cost of capital. So now use a mean of 9% and standard deviation of 2%, in addition to varying the growth
- Visualize and summarize the resulting probability distribution of the price
- Be careful as in some cases, the drawn cost of capital will be lower than the drawn growth rate, which breaks the DDM. You will need to modify your logic to throw out these cases.

Description
--------------

Level 1
^^^^^^^^^^

- Work off of your existing Project 1 Python model
- You are concerned the NPV could be heavily affected by changes in the interest rate. Instead of fixing it, draw it from a normal distribution with mean of 7% and standard deviation of 2%.
- Run the model 10,000 times and collect the NPV results. Visualize the results. Create a table of probabilities and the minimum NPV we could expect with that probability. Output the chance that the NPV will be more than \$400,000,000.

Level 2
^^^^^^^^^^

- Continue from the first lab exercise. Now you are also concerned that your assembly line will not be as efficient and so the number of phones per machine will be lower. So draw that from a normal distribution with mean 100,000 and standard deviation of 20,000. 
- As you run the model, also store what were the interest and number of phones corresponding to the NPV. You want to see which has a greater impact on the NPV: interest or number of phones. Visualize the relationship between interest and NPV, and the relationship between number of phones and NPV. Also run a regression to quantitatively determine which has a greater effect.

Description
--------------

Level 1
^^^^^^^^^^

- You will be running Monte Carlo simulations on your existing Excel model from Project 1
- You are concerned that your estimate for the number of phones that will be sold is incorrect. 
- The number of phones should instead be drawn from a normal distribution with mean 100,000 and standard deviation of 20,000.
- Estimate the model 1,000 times and output the results back to Excel
- In Excel, visualize the results.  Create a table of probabilities and the minimum NPV we could expect with that probability. Output the chance that the NPV will be more than \$400,000,000.

Level 2
^^^^^^^^^^

- Continue from the first lab exercise. Now you are also concerned that there is varying quality in the machines, so they may have a different lifespan. Draw that from a normal distribution with mean 10 years and standard deviation of 2 years.
- As you run the model, also store what were the number of phones and machine life corresponding to the NPV, all in Excel. You want to see which has a greater impact on the NPV: number of phones or machine life. Visualize the relationship between number of phones and NPV, and the relationship between beginning machine life and NPV. Try to determine which has a greater effect.
