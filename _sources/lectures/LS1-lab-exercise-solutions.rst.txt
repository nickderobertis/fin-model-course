Description

- Now we want to see the effect of savings rate on time until retirement, in addition to interest rate
- In both Excel and Python, calculate the years to retirement for savings rates of 10%, 25%, and 40%, and each of these cases with each of the interest rate cases, 4%, 5%, and 6%
- Be sure that you drag formulas in Excel and use for loops in Python to accomplish this
- In total you should have 9 calculated years to retirement numbers, in each of the two models.

- We want to relax the assumption that the amount needed in retirement is given by a fixed amount of desired cash
- Add new inputs to the model, "Annual Cash Spend During Retirement" and "Years in Retirement"
- Calculate desired cash based on interest, cash spend, and years in retirement
- Use the calculated desired cash in the model to determine years to retirement
